# Step by Step instructions to deploy a GitOps Ready Stack + Demo NodeJS App
For this GitOps stack we will be leveraging a variety of tools:
 - CircleCI
 - ArgoCD
 - Platform9 Managed Kubernetes Freedom
 - Example NodeJS app to be leveraged in your demo

**CircleCI** is a modern continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform. You can learn more about CircleCI at: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/about-circleci/

**ArgoCD** is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. You can find more information about this project at: https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/

**Platform9 Managed Kubernetes Freedom** provides to you pure-play open source Kubernetes that is delivered as a SaaS managed service. The Freedom plan is a zero-cost plan that offers a capacity of up to 3 clusters and 20 nodes (or 800 vCPUs), community Slack support, and built-in critical alerting. You can sign up here: https://platform9.com/signup/

When you follow these instruction you will get something like the below flow:

## Setup of a Platform9 Managed Kubernetes Freedom cluster
While the process is very straightforward, you can find the documentation to create a Platform9 Managed Kubernetes cluster here: https://docs.platform9.com/kubernetes/introduction/freedom-plan-faq/

## Example NodeJS app
In this setup we will be showcasing the instructions for a NodeJS application which is based upon the default react-app. This repo also contains the required files you'll use later on for CircleCI (eg. `.circleci`, `dockerfile`, etc.)
Clone the KoolKubernetes repo on GitHub, and cd into `cicd/gitops-stack/webapp01`. When you issue `npm install` followed with `npm start`, the application should open up in a browser. 
```Compiled successfully!

You can now view react-app01 in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
  On Your Network:  http://192.168.1.246:3000

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.

```
![webapp](images/webapp01.png)

There are three main files: 
The index.html file is the template that will be sent to the browser, while the code for the application reside in src/App.js. In package.json you can find some parameters of the app. The most useful parameters in this file are the `version` and `name` parameters.


## CircleCI Setup
*Optionally: Sign up for a CircleCI Free plan in case you do not yet have a CircleCI account. In case you have a Free or Enterprise account feel free to leverage this one as well*
You can create a CircleCI account at https://circleci.com/signup/ where you can opt for authentication via GitHub. To make life very easy, you can give CircleCI access to work with all your repos.
![circleci-signup](images/circleci-signup.png)

While the configuration of CircleCI is super intuitive and you can find detailed instructions at https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/getting-started/#section=getting-started, please find below some quick instructions to get things going.
1. Setup a CircleCI Project: Select  **Set Up Project** next to the repo you want to follow with CircleCI - in this example we'll be following the KoolKubernetes repo
![circleci-project](images/circleci-setupproject.png)
2. CircleCI offers a variety of config templates. Just select **Node** and click on **Start Building**
![circleci-startbuilding](images/circleci-startbuilding.png)
3. In the cloned repo you will find an example config file so you can select **Add Manually** and copy `KoolKubernetes/cicd/gitops-stack/.circleci` with its contents to the root of your repository. You do have to update the `.circleci/config.yml` with your Docker repo details. Once added you can click on **Start Building**

## Deployment of ArgoCD on one of your Platform9 Managed Kubernetes clusters
*Optionally: create a dedicated namespace for ArgoCD*
```bash
kubectl create namespace argocd
```
`
namespace/argocd created
`
```bash
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
```
`

### Install the Argo CD CLI on your computer.
For Mac you can use brew: 
```bash
brew tap argoproj/tap
brew install argoproj/tap/argocd
```
By default, the Argo CD API server is not exposed with an external IP. To access the API server, choose one of the following techniques to expose the Argo CD API server:

#### Option 1: Service Type Load Balancer
Change the argocd-server service type to `LoadBalancer`:
```bash
kubectl patch svc argocd-server -n argocd -p '{"spec": {"type": "LoadBalancer"}}'
```
#### Option 2: Ingress
Follow the ingress documentation on how to configure Argo CD with ingress: https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/operator-manual/ingress/

#### Option 3: Port Forwarding
Kubectl port-forwarding can also be used to connect to the API server
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
```
The API server can then be accessed using the `localhost:8080`

### Connect & Configure ArgoCD
Retrieve the password of the Argo CD API server
```bash
kubectl get pods -n argocd -l app.kubernetes.io/name=argocd-server -o name | cut -d'/' -f 2
```
You can now logon to the Argo CD UI with the `retrieved` password and the `admin` user

![argo-login](images/argo-login.png)
You can change the auto-generated password using the argocd CLI
```bash
argocd login 127.0.0.1:8080
```
`
WARNING: server certificate had error: x509: cannot validate certificate for 127.0.0.1 because it doesn't contain any IP SANs. Proceed insecurely (y/n)? y
Username: admin
Password:
'admin' logged in successfully
Context '127.0.0.1:8080' updated
`
```bash
argocd account update-password   
```
```
Enter current password:
Enter new password:
Confirm new password:
Password updated      
```

### *Optional: Add  your remote Kubernetes cluster(s) to ArgoCD*

#### kubectx
In the below example we're using Kubectx which is a nice addon to easily switch between clusters back and forth. You can find  [here](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx) more information about Kubectx

List all cluster contexts that are currently loaded
```
kubectx
```
```
cicd
edg01
edg02
```
```bash
argocd cluster add edg01
argocd cluster add edg02
```

```
INFO[0001] ServiceAccount "argocd-manager" created in namespace "kube-system"
INFO[0001] ClusterRole "argocd-manager-role" created
INFO[0001] ClusterRoleBinding "argocd-manager-role-binding" created
Cluster 'https://<<IP API Server>>' added
```
